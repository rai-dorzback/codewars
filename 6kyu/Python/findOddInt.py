'''
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

def find_it(arr):
    # loop through array and count how many times each number occurs
    for i in arr:
        # if it occurs an odd number of times (is not divisible by 2), return that number
        if arr.count(i) % 2 != 0:
            return [i]
