/*
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

  // object to hold counts of each number
  counts = {}
  arr.forEach(e => {
    // if the element is already a key in counts, then add 1 to it
    if(e in counts) {

    if(counts[key] === 1) {
      // return that key as a number
      return +key
    }

// METHOD 2
// find a number where the first and last index for it are the same, therefore meaning it only exists in the array once
