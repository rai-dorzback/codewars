'''
Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

For example:
a = 1
b = 4
--> [1, 2, 3, 4]
'''

# METHOD 1: lambda & list comprehension
between = lambda a, b : [i for i in range(a, b+1)]

# METHOD 2: list() function and range() function
between = lambda a, b : list(range(a,b+1))
