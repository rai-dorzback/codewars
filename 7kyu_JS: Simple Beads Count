/*
Two red beads are placed between every two blue beads. There are N blue beads. After looking at the arrangement below work out the number of red beads.

B RR B RR B

Implement count_red_beads(n) (in PHP count_red_beads($n); in Java, Javascript, TypeScript, C, C++ countRedBeads(n)) so that it returns the number of red beads.
If there are less than 2 blue beads return 0.
*/

// METHOD 1
let countRedBeads = n => {
  if (n < 2) return 0;
  else return (n * 2) - 2;
};

// METHOD 2: method 1 with ternary / on one line
let countRedBeads = n => n < 2 ? 0 : (n*2) - 2;
