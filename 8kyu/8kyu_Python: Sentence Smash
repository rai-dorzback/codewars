'''
Sentence Smash
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. 
You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. 
Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Example
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

def smash(words):
    newString = ''

    # for each word in the array of words
    for word in words:
        # add that word and a space to the newString
        newString += f"{word} "
    
    # strip spaces from either side of newString and return 
    return newString.strip()
