/*
What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.
*/

const addLength = s => s.split(' ').map(e => `${e} ${e.length}`);
// split string into array with space as delimiter
// map original array to add the element's length
