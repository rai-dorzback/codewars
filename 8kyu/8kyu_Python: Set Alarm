'''
Write a function named setAlarm/set_alarm/set-alarm/setalarm (depending on language) which 
receives two parameters. The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed 
and the second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on vacation.

The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation (because these are 
the circumstances under which you need to set an alarm). It should return false otherwise. Examples:

employed | vacation 
true     | true     => false
true     | false    => true
false    | true     => false
false    | false    => false
'''

# METHOD 1: will return true if they are employed and not on vacation and false otherwise
set_alarm = lambda employed, vacation : employed and not vacation

# METHOD 2
def set_alarm(employed, vacation):
    return employed and not vacation
