'''
I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.
'''
# create merged array, use for loop to sum 
def array_plus_array(arr1,arr2):
    merged = arr1 + arr2
    sum = 0
    for num in merged:
        sum += num
    return sum

# shorter way
def array_plus_array(arr1,arr2):
    return sum(arr1+arr2)
