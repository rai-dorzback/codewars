<p align="center">A repository filled with my solutions for codewars challenges (katas). I have completed 830+ unique solutions and push at least 7 challenges/katas weekly, typically in both JavaScript & Python & with multiple solutions for each challenge and language.</p>

  <p>
    Every morning, the first thing I do is solve a codewars kata in Python & JavaScript.

  <h2>Optimizations</h2>
  <p>I consistently optimize and refactor my code for readability/conciseness. You will see a lot of my challenges have multiple solutions.</p>

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>I have learned that there are tons of ways to solve the same problem & different people will have completely unique ways of solving the challenge. There is always more to learn & other methods to try! It's okay if you don't get something the first time-- you become a better engineer with practice and taking time to understand others' solutions. I have learned how to reason through problems that seem super confusing and break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.</p>
